## 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio

I’m **Jessica Herrera Perdomo**, a passionate data enthusiast with a background in biology, specialized in the pharmaceutical and environmental sectors.

My journey from science to data analytics has been driven by the same curiosity: understanding patterns, solving problems, and finding clarity in complexity.

I specialise in uncovering insights from messy datasets, automating workflows, and creating accessible resources to empower others in their data journey.



## 💫 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on data analytics projects, improving my skills through hands-on case studies and personal challenges.  
🌱 I’m deepening my knowledge in AI, business understanding, and advanced data tools.  
👯 I’m open to collaborate on data analytics and science projects - especially if they involve clarity, structure, or social/environmental value.  
⚡ Fun fact: I feel as excited exploring a messy dataset as I do spotting a rare insect on a nature walk - both are full of hidden patterns.

## 📚 What Drives Me

As a biologist turned data analyst, I’m deeply curious about solving real-world problems through data. I love making complex things easier to understand and designing simple, elegant solutions.

I bring a unique blend of scientific rigor and practical structure, with experience creating dashboards, automating workflows, and building templates that others can use and trust.

🧭 My mission is to help people and teams work better with their data - bringing clarity, reducing chaos, and empowering decision-making.

🤝 Let’s connect and build something meaningful together 🚀
